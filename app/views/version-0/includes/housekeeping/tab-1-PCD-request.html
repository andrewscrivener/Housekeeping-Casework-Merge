            address. Homer SIMPSON accused Marge SIMPSON of cheating on him and told her to leave his house. Marge
            SIMPSON has said no so Homer SIMPSON stood up in anger and told her to leave the address. Homer SIMPSON
            walked to the kitchen area and stood in front of Marge SIMPSON shouted leave my fucking house, with Marge
            SIMPSON shaking and in fear, Homer SIMPSON with his right hand clenched in a fist, raised this above his
            head and said that if she didn't leave the address then he would punch Marge SIMPSON. The defendant punched
            Marge SIMPSON to the side of her head leaving a red mark. Bart SIMPSON heard all this and seemed angry with
            Marge SIMPSON. Bart SIMPSON raised his hand and slapped Marge SIMPSON to the left side of her face.</p>

        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-10">I have reviewed this case and believe that the evidence justifies the
            prosecution. The Full Code Test has been met. Both elements of the Full Code Test have been carefully
            considered. I started off by reviewing the evidence and I can confirm I believe there is a realistic
            prospect of conviction. Once I was satisfied the evidential stage had been met I then applied the Public
            Interest stage. I will endorse this review with my findings below:</p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">The defendants are</p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">Homer Simpson</p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-10">Bart Simpson</p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">The proposed charges are as follows;</p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-10">• DV Common assault</p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">I have considered the EVIDENTIAL STAGE. My findings are as follows;</p>
        <p class="">This is a supported Domestic Violence Case against the victim Marge Simpson. On THURSDAY 30TH
            JANUARY 2025, the defendants and victim have been in her home address when the defendant has been accused
            the victim of cheating on him. The victim has denied this which has angered the defendant and caused him to
            stand up, tense up and shout “LEAVE MY FUCKING HOUSE”. The defendant has then clenched his right fist,
            raised it and said if she did not leave then he would punch her. He has then made more threats including ”I
            WILL SKULL DRAG YOU OUT OF THE ADDRESS” causing the victim to fear for her immediate and unlawful violence.
            The defendant himself left the address and the Police have been called.</p>
        <p class="">BART SIMPSON also slapped his mother to the left hand side of the face</p>
        <p class="">Police have attended the address and the victim stated over the last 2 years the defendant has
            accused her of cheating, demanding to know who she was with, wanting to know where she is, who she is with
            and stating she was unfaithful. The defendant demands access to the victims phone, goes though her phone and
            feels that she is being “controlled” by him. She feels if she does not do as told, then he will become angry
            and volatile.</p>
        <p class="">The victim has provided a statement to Police</p>
        <p class="">She has requested a Restraining Order</p>
        <p class="">I then considered the ANTICIPATED PLEA. Please find details and rationale as follows; the defendant
            was interviewed on FRIDAY 31ST JANUARY 2025 at CENTRAL PERK POLICE CUSTODY. The defendant was interviewed by
            PC MURRAY and denied both offences. Regarding the Common Assault, the defendant stated that the victim
            assaulted him.</p>
        <p class="">I can confirm the OIC has explored all reasonable lines of enquiry. </p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">I considered the PUBLIC INTEREST STAGE. My findings are as follows;</p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">This is a High Risk Domestic Incident between the victim and the defendant.
            The victim is terrified of the defendant but has been brave enough to provide a statement to the Police and
            is supporting a Police Prosecution.</p>
        <p class="">Further to this, there as been a 37% increase in violence against women an girls between 2018-2023.
            In 2023 alone, over 1 million crimes against women and girls were recorded in England and Wales which makes
            up 20% of crimes recorded by Police.</p>
        <p class="">Globally, 1 in 3 women experience VAWG.</p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-10">VAWG is prevalent in the Media, and the expectation is Police take positive
            action against it. The Public would rightly expect Police arrest these offenders and for the CPS to expedite
            charges and remands for those who commit VAWG / Domestic Violence.</p>
        <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-0">DISCLOSURE TEST:</p>
        <p class="">I have had sight of the respective schedule. I have not inspected all the material but I am informed
            by the OIC that there is no disclosable material.</p>
        <p class="">I can confirm this file meets National File Standards</p>
        <p class="">The OIC details in this case are as follows; 9069 Morse –– Central Perk Police Custody,</p>
